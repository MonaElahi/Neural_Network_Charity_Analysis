Overview of the analysis

The purpose of his analysis to create machine learning and neural networks 
models by using the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier 
that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

Results

Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
The target variable is "IS_SUCCESSFUL" which is a binary data, classifies charity is successful or not.

What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

All the below variables except of "IS_SUCCESSFUL" are features.

What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

There are two noisy varibales which should be dropped from data for percision.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
